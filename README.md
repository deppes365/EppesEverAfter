Welcome to EppesEverAfter.

This is a wedding website that I made for my brother and his fiance.
This is the first website that I ever made live.

This website was a great learning experience because I got to work with a deadline. 
I also had the opportunity to take someone's idea of what they wanted their website to look like, and make it a reality.
